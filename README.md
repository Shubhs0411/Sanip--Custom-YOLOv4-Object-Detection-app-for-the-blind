# Sanip--Custom-YOLOv4-Object-Detection-app-for-the-blind

We propose a shopping assistant model SANIP
to help blind persons to detect hand held objects and also
to get a video feedback of the information retrieved from
the detected and recognized objects. The proposed model
consists of three python models i.e. Custom Object
Detection, Text Detection and Barcode detection. For
object detection of the hand held object, we have created
our own custom dataset that comprises daily goods such as
Parle-G, Tide, Lays. Other than that we have also collected
images of Cart and Exit signs as it is essential for any
person to use a cart and also notice the exit sign in case of
emergency. For the other 2 models proposed the text and
barcode information retrieved is converted from text to
speech and relayed to the Blind person. The model was
used to detect objects that were trained on and was
successful in detecting and recognizing the desired output
with a good accuracy and precision.
